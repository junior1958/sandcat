##Task Object

Sandcat can launch Lua scripts to perform operations in an isolated process. The tasks can be monitored and managed from the Tasks page.

###Methods

Methods available from within an isolated process of a Sandcat Task:

* **task:browserdostring** ( luacode ): Runs a Lua script in the browser process.

* **task:browsernewtab** ( url ): Opens a URL in a new tab

* **task:dopackfile** ( pakfilename, scriptfilename): Loads and runs a Lua script that is inside an extension package

* **task:logrequest** ( json ) Can be used to manually log a request from a custom HTTP client class to the Live Headers list. Accepts the same keys as the tab:logrequest() method.

* **task:getpackfile** ( pakfilename, filename): Gets the contents of a file that is inside the specified extension package. Returns `string`

* **task:sendrequest** ( json ): Performs a custom HTTP request in the tab that launched the task and adds the request to the Live Headers list. Accepts the same keys as the tab:loadrequest() method, but here they must be provided as a JSON object.

* **task:setprogress** ( position [, max] ): Updates the progress bar from the task progress monitor panel. If the second parameter is omitted, 100 is used as maximum value

* **task:setscript** ( event, luacode ): Sets a Lua code to be executed during specific task progress monitor panel events (eg: onclick, ondblclick, onstop)

* **task:showmessage** ( s ): Displays a message to the user

* **task:stop** ( reason ): Manually stops the task. Sandcat will automatically call this method at the end of the task execution (if the method has not been called before).
