## Catalunya

Catalunya is a multi-purpose set of Lua extensions developed to be used in the Sandcat Browser. Currently, this library extends Lua with over 60 functions and some useful classes.

In Sandcat, Catalunya is available as the **ctk** global. For a list of available functions, see [functions.md](https://github.com/exlunaproject/catarinka/blob/master/catalunya/docs/lua.functions.md).

### Classes

All Catalunya classes (described in `classes.*` under the [Catalunya Docs](https://github.com/exlunaproject/catarinka/blob/master/catalunya/docs/) are available.

Each class has a "new" method that must be used for creating the object and a "release" method for freeing it.
